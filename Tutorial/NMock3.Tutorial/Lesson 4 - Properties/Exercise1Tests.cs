	/// <summary>
	/// 
	/// Now that you have seen some expectations in action, lets move on to more
	/// complex scenarios that involve properties.
	/// 
	/// Mocking properties is very similar to events.  You will set up an expectation
	/// that a property will be accessed through its getter or setter.  With this in
	/// mind, you can predict that there are two property expectation types: get and
	/// set.
	/// 
	/// Lets explore getting property values.  When code is calling the getter of a
	/// property the code expects some value back.  Think about how that would work
	/// if the code was interacting with an interface.  What actual value would be 
	/// returned?  The mocking framework provides the ability to specify the value
	/// to be returned to the calling code when the expectation is created.
	///
